          <h2>More about me</h2>
          <p>
            Beth Harmon has over ten years of experience in the field of special education.  Originally from the east coast, Beth earned her Bachelor’s degree in Italian and in general education in 2001. She worked for 2 years after graduation at "The Campus School," a school for students with multiple and severe special needs.  In 2007, she earned a Masters degree from Boston University in Speech and Language Pathology. During that time she interned and later worked at the “Ely Center” in Newton, MA, a private practice for higher functioning students with Autism with pragmatic language and social skills needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduation, Beth worked for 5 years at the Pacific Autism Center for Education (PACE) in Santa Clara, CA as a Speech and Language Pathologist. She gained experience working with students aged 3-22 with various degrees of Autism ranging from mild to severe. Following PACE, she spent time working at the Morgan Autism Center in San Jose, CA working with a simliar population utilizing the "Morgan Center Model" for educational services. Across both settings, she gained extensive knowledge in AAC (Alternative and Augmentative Communication) while working with low and high tech voice-output devices including Big Mac, Tech-4, GoTalk, Dynavox, Vantage, Accent, and iPad with communication apps such as Proloquo2Go, TouchChat and LAMP.  She also created hundreds of low-tech visual supports using Boardmaker. In addition, she spearheaded projects and provided trainings in the integration of technology use into best speech therapy and educational practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth is passionate about helping students communicate effectively in social situations, as well as helping them find the joy and desire to form bonds with peers and adults using effective communication strategies. She is dedicated to integrating technology across her therapy practice as a means to increase her client's independence in communication. Her hobbies include running, cycling and yoga.
